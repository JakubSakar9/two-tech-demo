- Use character feet to make footprints in the snow
- Use 49 or 81 (make it a setting) textures which capture the nearest chunks
- When encoutering a past chunk reconstruct footprints using a compute shader
- At a certain radious fade the footprints out to avoid sharp footprints popping
- Write a compute shader that precomputes a wind vector field over the map (in sets of nine chunks, use asynchronous computation during runtime)
- Create a snow particle system that follows the player
- Affect the velocity of the particles using the wind vector field
- Footprints Audio
- Wind spatial audio based on the current wind velocity
- Precompute a snow height texture based on the heightmap and wind vector field
- Use the snow height texture in the terrain shader and use a ground texture for places with no snow
- Decrease footprint depth when changing a chunk if it is snowing
- Optimize footprints render distance by only using textures for the chunks where footprints are rendered
- Limit a number of chunks with footprints and discard the latest ones
- Update the discard policy to not discard textures which are nearby
